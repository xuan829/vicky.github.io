<h1 align=center>BSc Psychology</h1>
<p style="font-family:arial;">At the University of Reading Malaysia, we study psychology at many levels - from how the brain functions to the ways that individuals are affected by membership of a group.
<br>Learning from internationally regarded experts, you will be introduced to the latest evidence relating to a wide range of topics in the field of psychology, gaining a solid grounding in all the core areas of the discipline.
<br>You will also undertake work placements and applied projects that encourage you to link the topics you are studying to the issues experienced in 'real world' settings.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">Throughout the programme, you will be made aware of current research - its concepts, methods, findings and unresolved issues - and you will learn both how to evaluate others'research and how to carry it out yourself.
<br>In your final year, you will be able to tailor the course to your own areas of interest and career ambitions. You will study the latest research evidence relating to a selection of topics from psychology and neuroscience in depth.
<br>You will carry out an original research project that will add to current knowledge in that field and discover how psychological research can impact on real life practices in education, health and industry.
</p>

<p style="font-family:arial;">According to the Times Higher Education's World University Rankings 2019, the Psychology programme at University of Reading is in the top 150 in the world. 
<br>The psychology programme at the University of Reading Malaysia is accredited by the British Psychological Society (BPS), the professional body that oversees the quality of psychology degree provision in the UK. 
<br>This accreditation gives our graduates eligibility for Graduate Basis for Chartered (GBC) Membership and, through this, access to postgraduate training courses in UK and elsewhere.

<div class="ABC">Law Zi Ling, BSc (Hons) Psychology</div>
<p style="font-family:arial;">Hi! I'm Law Zi Ling, was a Foundation in Science student and also a (BSc) Psychology graduate from both Reading Malaysia and UK (2+2). 
<br>I have had the best university life with Reading as I did the transfer programme that was offered. 
<br>I am truly grateful for the lecturers that have taught me from Foundation year up until part 3 of Psychology. 
<br>I have great academic tutors that continuously check up on me on my academic progress and they have been the most helpful people during my university days as they advised and motivated me to continue striving. 
<br>The modules taught has prepared me in being a good researcher as I learned to use certain software and analytical skills that are essential for the job I have currently as a Research Assistant at Sunway University. 
<br>I have gained many experiences aside from academics such as volunteering work, being a student ambassador, a facilitator and was able to be Events Manager in the Malaysian club in the UK. 
<br>This has helped me gained and enhanced my employability skills.

<div class="ABC">Ting Jia En, BSc (Hons) Psychology</div>
<p style="font-family:arial;"> Hi there! I'm Ting Jia En, a graduating student from BSc Psychology.
<br>I landed a job in the Human Resource department recently, and I aspire to specialise in industrial psychology in the near future. 
<br>During my academic years, I found that the most exciting and memorable experience is the final year project, which I worked closely with my research partner and supervisor from end to end on a research gap in the literature.
<br>My genuine advice to fellow and prospective students would be do not only focus on your academics, but also actively involve yourself in co-curriculum activities to gain leadership opportunities and polish up your soft skills. 
<br>I personally think this currently is the most important aspect to stand out from other graduates.

<div class="ABC">Victoria Ong, BSc (Hons) Psychology</div>
<p style="font-family:arial;">Hi, I am Victoria Ong. I graduated from the University of Reading Malaysia Psychology programme in 2018. 
<br>As a psychology graduate from UoRM, it's opened up a lot of opportunities for me. 
<br>With all the efforts of the staff, I was more than ready to take up new challenges in the working environment. 
<br>I was employed by Watsons Singapore as their Management Trainee, finding modules that had been taught such as Careers Psychology, Psychology at Work or even Social Psychology to be relevant. 
<br>Then, I moved on to being a Student Mentor with one of the biggest student care company in Singapore, modules such as Developmental Psychology was very relevant to my experience. 
<br>Soon after, I was accepted into the MA Psychology and Education programme at the University of Warwick. 
<br>Without the degree from UoRM that was accredited by BPS, I believe that my chances to be accepted was much lower. 
<br>My advice to prospective students is that, take the daring step and you will be surprised on how much the reward is.
